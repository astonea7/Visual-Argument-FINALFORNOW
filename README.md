# Visual-Argument-FINALFORNOW
The main repository I had for my visual argument was too crowded and disorganized. This is a reupload of everything that was already there!

I have owned 2 phones in my life. The first was a Samsung Galaxy J7 and the second is the iPhone 12 Pro Max that I currently use now. Being as I have used both of the most popular and major types of smartphones, I know how rough the experience can be between these brands. There were many issues I had with my Samsung that made it frustrating to use. For example. being added to group chats was not something people wanted to do with me,so I had to use GroupMe and felt like a nuisance to others. Another thing I couldn't stand was trying to send and save pictures and videos when texting because they would always be bad quality and blurry. There were also things like video calling and having read receipts and other features that would be missing from my messaging experience. This only ever happened when I would text iPhone users as a Samsung user. I recently found out that it's due to Apple's stubbornness that everyone has to suffer! Thanks to Android and Google's #GetTheMessage campaign that started in 2022 I discovered that all these issues happened because Apple was using an old software (SMS/MMS) from the 90s that was unencrypted and outdated. We now have somethings called Rich Communication Services or RCS that every other smartphone uses, except Apple! 

After seeing this ad, I was upset knowing that non-Apple and Apple users alike were going through unnecessary difficulty when texting because Apple wanted to gatekeep and be a big bully. This is what my visual argument is meant to encompass. It is supposed to be an ad for the #GetTheMessage campaign to help spread the word. Using the repetition and color, I used two identical messaging bubbles, but made sure one was green and the other blue. This was to represent the way that messages between iPhones and non-iPhones show up on Apple devices. I wanted to make it seem like messages were being sent between Apple and Android and how they were having a discussion about this issue. Apple has a problem with their outdated system and Android presents the solution with their new and improved one!

Some tools I used were Text, Color Picker, Paint, and Erase, Fill, Fuzzy Select, Select by Color, and Paths to make my vision happen. Fonts was another thing I wanted to work on because it would have been cool to match Appleâ€™s font like Google/Android did in their #GetTheMessage campaign ads! I then got the idea to make it somewhat symmetrical and in nature and chose to incorporate the green and blue text bubbles into the mix themselves. I like that my new design is more clear and hopefully easier to understand without having much background knowledge on the issue!
